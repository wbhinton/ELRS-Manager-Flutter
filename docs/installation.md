# Installation

**Current Release:** You can install the latest version of ELRS Mobile directly from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/releases) page.
- **Android:** Download and install the `.apk` file. *(Note: You may need to enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in your Android settings).*

**Coming Soon:** If there is enough interest generated, we plan to publish ELRS Mobile to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store in the near future to make installation and updates seamless.
